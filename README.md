# make_the_box_full_python
A simple puzzle game where you need to fill the generated grid by moving the 'X'. All passed tiles will count as filled and there are pre-filled tiles that serve as walls and cannot be walked into by 'X'.
The game automatically ends if you have nowhere to move. The program makes a new grid every time you win or lose.
